          My name is Matt Bilton and this is my portfolio website.
          I'm glad you could find it. I've spent most of the last decade as
          a full-stack web-developer, but I also have a degree in Physics, an
          interest in Mathematics, a love of making music, and a passable grasp
          of Japanese (which is where I live these days).
        `,

          Below you will find a quick summary of my work history so far, and on the
          other pages of this site you'll find some links to any other things I'm working
          on.
